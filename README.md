# Classification-on-FIFA-Dataset-Using-Deep-Learning

This notebook will show how to implement a neural network model using Keras on the FIFA dataset.  

The dataset used for our problem has complete data about all the players and their attributes data in FIFA-19 games by EA Sports. It includes all competitive football player’s details. We can get the dataset from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19. 

We have 18207 player’s details with around 88 features for each player. The position of the player is a feature which we would like to predict with the help of the rest of the features available with us. So here we train our Deep learning model to classify the test data and predict to which position the player would be belonging to with all the attributes associated with that player.
